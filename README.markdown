# Rack::RESTfulController

I had a crazy idea the other day. Write a class that _looks_ like a "RESTful" Rails controller. Pass it to Rack. And with the help of a little middleware action... voilÃ !

Only today, when I fleshed it out completely did I think, "This could be useful for writing a quick prototype then moving it to Rails when it's ready." It's _probably_ useful for that too.

This is the fruition of those things.

## Install

    gem install rack-restful-controller -s http://gemcutter.org

## Usage

### config.ru

    require 'rack/restful-controller'
    
    class Foo
      def index
        "this is the index" # return a string, it becomes [200, {...}, ["this is the index"]]
      end
    
      def show
      end
    
      def create
        [302, {'Location' => '/42', ...}, ["body"]] # return an array, and it's just passed along to Rack
      end
    
      def edit
      end
    
      def update
      end
    
      def destroy
      end
    
      def foo
      end
    
      def bar
      end
    end
    
    use Rack::RESTfulController, :collection => {:foo => :get}, :member => {:bar => :get}
    run Rack::RESTfulController.as(Foo)

## Caveats

* Rack::RESTfulController#call isn't really that robust, but it works. Welcome to suggestions.
* I don't really like the name of Rack::RESTfulController.as, but it was the best I could think of at the time.

## TODO

* TEST
* Write a *few* helper methods; redirect_to, *_path, *_url
